## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Fresh green (#A7D1AB) to evoke a sense of health, nature, and vitality, reflecting the brand's focus on fresh, natural ingredients. The association with the color green and its symbolic representation of life and renewal aligns perfectly with Greezo's emphasis on a nourished lifestyle.
- Background color: Very light green (#F0FAF2), offering a clean, subtle backdrop that doesn't distract from the vibrant food imagery and text.
- Accent color: Muted yellow (#D4AC0D) to highlight calls to action, like the 'View Details' and 'Confirm Order' buttons, drawing the user's attention to key interactive elements without overpowering the serene and natural color scheme.
- Font pairing: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for headlines, providing a modern, precise, and fashionable feel, and 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for body text, offering a balance of modernity with warmth and readability.
- Use minimalist icons for navigation and interactive elements. The icons should be related to food, health, and nature. Simple and easily recognizable.
- Implement a clean and modern layout, ensuring responsiveness across devices. Use cards and sections to organize content effectively, with a focus on visual hierarchy.
- Incorporate subtle animations such as fade-ins and smooth transitions when scrolling or interacting with elements to enhance the user experience. Ensure animations are lightweight and do not detract from the site's performance.
